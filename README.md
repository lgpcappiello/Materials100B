# STAT 100B Materials

Original tex and rmd files for STAT 100B slides and labs. With the exception of s11_, materials are based on OpenIntro Statistics fourth edition by David M Diez, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, and Christopher D Barr. The experimental design slides are based on the 13th edition of Introduction to Probability & Statistics by Mendenhall, Beaver, and Beaver.

For more complete slides on sections 4.1, 5.1, 5.3, and 7.1, see my STAT 100A materials.

Many of the images come directly from the OpenIntro Statistics text associated with that section.

Labs are based on the lab format from OpenIntro. Author credits are included at the end of each lab.
