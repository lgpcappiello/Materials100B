\begin{frame}{The Completely Randomized Design}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Random samples are selected independently from each of $k$ populations.
        \item There is only one factor, so this is called a \textbf{one-way classification}.
        \item Sound familiar? We already know how to analyze this data!
        \item We can analyze completely randomized designs using \\ $t$-tests ($k=1$ or $2$) or ANOVA ($k > 2$).
    \end{itemize}
